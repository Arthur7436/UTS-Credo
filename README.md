# UTS Credo - Mark Credo


## About
Initially, this project was given by a friend in a social club at UTS called 'Credo'. The task given to me was to replicate and rebuild from scratch using Bootsrap 5, the original 'Mark Credo' website which can be seen <a href="https://mark.credo.org.au/">here</a>. This website consisted of 11 responsive webpages that was built using Oxygen and Wordpress originally. At the time I did not know how to use Bootstrap 5, however, was able to complete the whole project (along with learning this framework) within 1 week. In the middle of building this project, I used a language that I have not used before (PHP) and used it to my advantage to build the 11 webpages more efficiently.

This project has allowed me to solidfy my understanding of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5.
