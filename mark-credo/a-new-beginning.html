        <h2>Mark 15:40-16:8</h2>
        <p1>40 Some women were watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joseph, and Salome. 41 In Galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were also there.</p>

      <h2>The Burial of Jesus</h2>
      <p>42 It was Preparation Day (that is, the day before the Sabbath). So as evening approached, 43 Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Council, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for Jesus’ body. 44 Pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him if Jesus had already died. 45 When he learned from the centurion that it was so, he gave the body to Joseph. 46 So Joseph bought some linen cloth, took down the body, wrapped it in the linen, and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock. Then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. 47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where he was laid.</p>
     <h2>Jesus Has Risen</h2>
     <p>16 When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body. 2 Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb 3 and they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?”</p>
     <p>4 But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. 5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.</p>
     <p>6 “Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. 7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.’”</p>
     <p>8 Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.</p>

    <h1>Glossary</h1>
    <p><strong class="fst-italic">Sabbath</strong>: Our Saturday. It held special significance in ancient Israel as it had been designated by God in the Old Testament writings as a day of rest to remember God’s provision for them in creation and salvation. By Jesus’ day, there was a long list of things you could not do on the Sabbath for fear of breaking the ‘don’t work, but rest’ purpose of the day.</p>
