        <h1>Mark 10:17-38<h1>
        <h2>The Rich and the Kingdom of God</h2>
        <p>17 As Jesus started on his way, a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him. “Good teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?”</p>
        <p>18 “Why do you call me good?” Jesus answered. “No one is good—except God alone. 19 You know the commandments: ‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not give false testimony, you shall not defraud, honor your father and mother.’”</p>
        <p>20 “Teacher,” he declared, “all these I have kept since I was a boy.”</p>
        <p>21 Jesus looked at him and loved him. “One thing you lack,” he said. “Go, sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.”</p>
        <p>22 At this the man’s face fell. He went away sad, because he had great wealth.</p>
        <p>23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God!”</p>
        <p>24 The disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said again, “Children, how hard it is to enter the kingdom of God! 25 It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</p>
        <p>26 The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can be saved?”</p>
        <p>27 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but not with God; all things are possible with God.”</p>
        <p>28 Then Peter spoke up, “We have left everything to follow you!”</p>
        <p>29 “Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel 30 will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age to come eternal life. 31 But many who are first will be last, and the last first.”</p>

      <div>
        <h2>Jesus Predicts His Death a Third Time</h2>
        <p>32 They were on their way up to Jerusalem, with Jesus leading the way, and the disciples were astonished, while those who followed were afraid. Again he took the Twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him. 33 “We are going up to Jerusalem,” he said, “and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the teachers of the law. They will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the Gentiles, 34 who will mock him and spit on him, flog him and kill him. Three days later he will rise.”

        <h2>The Request of James and John
        </h2>
        <p>35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him. “Teacher,” they said, “we want you to do for us whatever we ask.”</p>
        <p>36 “What do you want me to do for you?” he asked.</p>
        <p>37 They replied, “Let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory.”</p>
        <p>38 “You don’t know what you are asking,” Jesus said. “Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptized with the baptism I am baptized with?”</p>
