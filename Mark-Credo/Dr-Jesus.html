    <h2>Jesus Forgives and Heals a Paralyzed Man</h2>
        <p>2 A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. 2 They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. 3 Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. 4 Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. 5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”</p>
        <p>6 Now some teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, 7 “Why does this fellow talk like that? He’s blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</p>
        <p>8 Immediately Jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts, and he said to them, “Why are you thinking these things? 9 Which is easier: to say to this paralyzed man, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up, take your mat and walk’? 10 But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.” So he said to the man, 11 “I tell you, get up, take your mat and go home.” 12 He got up, took his mat and walked out in full view of them all. This amazed everyone and they praised God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</p>

    <h2>Jesus Calls Levi and Eats With Sinners</h2>
        <p>13 Once again Jesus went out beside the lake. A large crowd came to him, and he began to teach them. 14 As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax collector’s booth. “Follow me,” Jesus told him, and Levi got up and followed him.</p>
        <p>15 While Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. 16 When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples: “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</p>
        <p>17 On hearing this, Jesus said to them, “It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</p>

    <p><strong class="fst-italic">Son of Man</strong>: Another loaded title from the Old Testament Scriptures. The figure of the ‘Son of Man’ featured in key parts of the Old Testament writings such as Daniel 7 as someone who is human and yet sharing in God’s rule of the world.</p>
    <p><strong class="fst-italic">Sinners and Tax Collectors</strong>: A collective term in Mark referring to people who were publicly known as bad. They are a sort of societal opposite to the Pharisees in the story.</p>
    <p><strong class="fst-italic">Pharisee</strong>: The Pharisees were a particular religious sect in first-century Israel. They sought complete obedience to the Law of Moses and were renowned for inventing extra regulations to ensure they didn’t break any of the instructions of the Old Testament writings.</p>
